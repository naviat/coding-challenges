# Coding Challenges

> Note: This repository is based on [Coding Challenges - John Crickett](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges)

This repository is a weekly coding challenge. These are challenges that Iâ€™ve used or am using as exercises to learn a new programming language or technology.

Each challenge will have you writing a full application or tool. Most of which will be based on real-world tools and utilities.

The challenges are picked to be small enough to be completed in your spare time over a week or two and yet large enough to be complete working projects.

## Table of Contents

1. [Write Your Own `wc` Tool](challenge-1/README.md)
2. [Write Your Own JSON Parser](challenge-2/README.md)
3. [Write Your Own Compression Tool](challenge-3/README.md)
4. [Write Your Own `cut` Tool](challenge-4/README.md)


## Challenge Structure

- **Real-World Relevance**: Each challenge is designed to reflect a real-world application or tool, providing me with a tangible outcome that demonstrates the utility and impact of my work.
- **Scope and Scale**: The challenges are carefully chosen to be achievable within a week or two, respecting the balance between my personal and professional life. Despite their compact size, each project is a complete and functional entity, offering a rewarding sense of accomplishment upon completion.
- **Learning Journey**: For each challenge, I dive into an introductory overview, followed by any necessary background information. This approach ensures a well-rounded understanding and sets the stage for the coding task ahead.
- **Validation**: Upon completing each challenge, I follow detailed instructions or scripts to test and validate my solutions, ensuring functionality and reliability.

## My Goals

- **Skill Advancement**: Through consistent practice and exploration of new territories in programming and technology, I aim to elevate my proficiency and adaptability as a software engineer.
- **Portfolio Development**: This repository serves as a dynamic portfolio, showcasing my ability to tackle diverse challenges and produce meaningful, working software solutions.
- **Community Engagement**: I am eager to connect with fellow coders, share insights, and gather feedback. Collaboration and community are cornerstones of growth in the tech world.
